If you want to control sending messages in Whatsapp just with you machine , and specify the time fix to send messages to People or Business , Workmates ... etc
Here you are , i made a : 
1.Python script : using Selenium lib and other libs to control the browser and HTML/CSS Shown 
2.Script shell :  remove all browse trace in your processor ( you can't connect with Whatsapp web in 2 pages )
3.Crontab : specifying the time to execute the scrip
